# Minidoctor
The minidoctor porgram is a naive conversational intelligence that generates sentences given the client's vocabulary and a basis lexicon. To run the minidoctor program, navigate to the directory where both the minidoctor files are stored. Initialize the erl shell by typing erl in the cmd. Compile the minidoctor code by typing c(minidoctor). Interact with the program by running minidoctor:start(). (periods inclusive)
